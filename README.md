# UX Design Reflection HW

Tomorrow we will be learning more about UX Design and on Friday we will be working briefly with UX Designers from the UXDI course.

Tonight's homework is simply to read up on the basic concepts of UX Design so you are better equipped for our collaboration with UX on Thursday/Friday.

1. Read up on UX Design.
  - Which articles / blog posts did you read?
  - What is "UX"?
  - How do UX Designers add value to a product team / company?
  - What does the daily work of a "UX Designer" look like?
2. Prepare some questions for our UX Guest Instructor.

## Using GFM

Type your reflections on the topics specified above using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/). GFM is a common format used for things like README files (this file is formatted in GFM).

Here are how you write some common elements in GFM:

- **paragraphs** – Paragraphs are simply typed out with an empty line between them. No special formatting needed:
  ```
  Hi, I'm a paragraph.
  
  Me too. I'm another paragraph.
  ```
- **headings** – Headings are on their own line preceded by a 'hash' symbol and a space.
  ```
  # I am a top-level heading (H1)
  ## I am another heading (H2)
  ### More heading (H3)
  #### I am another heading (H4)
  ```
- **lists** – Lists are on their own line, preceded by `- ` for unordered (bullet) lists and `1. ` etc for numbered lists.
  ```
  - I am a bullet point
  - Another bullet

  1. Let's count
  2. Count some more
  3. Three! Three list items! A-ha-haaa~~
  ```
- **code** – Inline code is surrounded by backticks (\`). Multi-line code blocks are surrounded by three backticks:
  ````
  ```
  // this is a block of code
  // it will get highlighted accordingly
  var a = 5;
  var b = 3;
  var c = a + b;
  ```
  ````
